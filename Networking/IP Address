IP Address

An IP address is a unique numerical identifier assigned to a device on a network.
It allows devices to identify each other and communicate over a network.

Without IP addresses, devices wouldn’t know where to send or receive data.

Types of IP Address Formats

IPv4
	•	32-bit address
	•	Written in decimal format (e.g., 192.168.1.10)
	•	Limited number of addresses (~4.3 billion)

IPv6
	•	128-bit address
	•	Written in hexadecimal
	•	Created to solve IPv4 exhaustion
	•	Supports a vastly larger number of addresses

Viewing IP Addresses
	•	ipconfig → Used on Windows to view IP configuration.
	•	ifconfig (older) or ip addr → Used on Linux systems.

Private vs Public IP Addresses

Private IP
	•	Used inside a local network (home, school, office).
	•	Not directly accessible from the internet.
	•	Assigned by a router or DHCP server.

Public IP
	•	Assigned by an ISP.
	•	Used to identify your network on the internet.
	•	What websites see when you connect to them.

⸻

NAT (Network Address Translation)

NAT allows multiple devices with private IP addresses to share one public IP address.

It translates:
Private IP → Public IP (when sending traffic out)
Public IP → Correct private IP (when traffic returns)

Without NAT, every device would need its own public IP.

Static vs Dynamic IP Addresses

Static IP
	•	Manually assigned.
	•	Does not change.
	•	Ideal for servers, printers, or systems that must always be reachable.

Dynamic IP
	•	Automatically assigned.
	•	Can change over time.
	•	Managed by DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).
