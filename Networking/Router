📡 Router – Networking Fundamentals

🔹 What is a Router?

A router is a Layer 3 network device that connects different networks together and forwards data packets between them using IP addresses.

Its primary role is to determine the best path for data to travel from a source network to a destination network.

🔹 Core Functions of a Router

1️⃣ Packet Forwarding

Routers examine the destination IP address in a packet and use a routing table to determine where to send it next.

2️⃣ Network Address Translation (NAT)

Routers translate private IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.x.x) into a public IP address so multiple devices can share a single internet connection.

Example:
	•	Laptop: 192.168.1.10
	•	Phone: 192.168.1.11
	•	Router public IP: 86.x.x.x

NAT allows both devices to access the internet using one public IP.

3️⃣ Default Gateway

In a local network, the router acts as the default gateway.
If a device wants to communicate outside its local network, it sends the traffic to the router.

4️⃣ Basic Firewall & Security

Most routers include built-in firewall functionality that:
	•	Blocks unsolicited inbound traffic
	•	Filters traffic based on rules
	•	Helps protect internal devices from external threats

🔹 Router vs Switch (Quick Comparison)

Feature	Router	Switch
OSI Layer	Layer 3 (Network)	Layer 2 (Data Link)
Uses	IP addresses	MAC addresses
Connects	Different networks	Devices within the same network
Internet Access	Yes	No

🔹 Real-World Example

When a user opens a website:
	1.	Device sends request to router.
	2.	Router performs NAT and forwards traffic to ISP.
	3.	ISP routes traffic to the internet.
	4.	Response returns to router.
	5.	Router forwards data back to correct internal device.

⸻

🔹 Key Takeaways
	•	A router connects networks.
	•	It forwards packets using IP addresses.
	•	It performs NAT.
	•	It acts as the default gateway.
	•	It typically includes basic firewall security.
