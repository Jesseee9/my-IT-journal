TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are both transport layer protocols used to send data across networks.

The main difference between them is reliability vs speed.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

TCP is connection-oriented and reliable.

Before data is sent, TCP establishes a connection using a 3-way handshake:
	1.	SYN
	2.	SYN-ACK
	3.	ACK

Once the connection is established:
	•	Data is sent in segments
	•	Each segment has a sequence number
	•	The receiver sends acknowledgements (ACKs)
	•	If data is lost, it is retransmitted
	•	Data is reassembled in the correct order

Key Characteristics:
	•	Reliable delivery
	•	Ordered data transmission
	•	Error detection and retransmission
	•	Higher overhead
	•	Slightly more latency

Common Use Cases:
	•	Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS)
	•	Email
	•	File transfers (FTP)
	•	Remote access (SSH)

TCP is used when accuracy matters more than speed.

⸻

UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

UDP is connectionless and faster.

There is:
	•	No handshake
	•	No acknowledgement
	•	No retransmission
	•	No guarantee of order

Data is sent as independent packets called datagrams.

Key Characteristics:
	•	Faster transmission
	•	Lower overhead
	•	No guaranteed delivery
	•	No guaranteed order

Common Use Cases:
	•	Online gaming
	•	Live streaming
	•	VoIP (voice calls)
	•	DNS queries

UDP is used when speed matters more than perfection.

Comparison Table

Feature	TCP	UDP
Connection required	Yes	No
Reliable	Yes	No
Ordered delivery	Yes	No
Error recovery	Yes (retransmits)	No
Speed	Slower	Faster
Best for	Accuracy-critical tasks	Real-time applications

Key Takeaway

TCP ensures data arrives correctly and in order, even if it requires retransmission.
UDP prioritizes speed and low latency, even if some data is lost.

Choosing between TCP and UDP depends on the application requirements — reliability vs real-time performance.
