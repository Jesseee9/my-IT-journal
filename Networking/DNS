## DNS (Domain Name System)

From my understanding, DNS is like a translator.

Computers don’t understand human language — they communicate using numbers (IP addresses). Humans prefer using names like www.google.com.

So DNS translates a domain name into an IP address so computers can communicate properly.

## Why DNS Is Important

Without DNS, we would have to type the full IP address of a website instead of its name.

For example, instead of typing www.google.com, we would need to remember and type its IP address.

DNS makes the internet easier for humans to use.

What DNS Servers Do

DNS servers help locate the IP address linked to a domain name.

They do not process or load the website itself — they only help find where the website is located.

Once the IP address is found, your browser connects to that IP to load the website.

Types of DNS Servers (Basic Idea)

There are different DNS servers that work together:
	•	Root Server
	•	TLD Server (.com, .org, etc.)
	•	Authoritative Name Server

They work step-by-step to help find the correct IP address.

Useful Command

On Windows Command Prompt:

nslookup domainname.com

This shows the IP address linked to a domain and the DNS server that responded.
