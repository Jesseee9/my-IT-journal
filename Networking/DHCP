DHCP is what automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.

Instead of manually setting an IP address on every computer, DHCP does it for you. That’s what makes it efficient.

There are two types of IP address assignments:
	•	Static – manually set by an administrator
	•	Dynamic – automatically assigned by DHCP

Dynamic IP addresses are handled by the DHCP server.

What Happens When a Device Turns On

When a device powers on and connects to a network, it doesn’t have an IP address yet.

So it sends a broadcast message across the network basically saying, “Is there a DHCP server here?”

It broadcasts because it doesn’t know the server’s address yet.

The DHCP Process (DORA)

From what I learned, DHCP follows a 4-step process called DORA:
	1.	Discover – The device broadcasts to find a DHCP server.
	2.	Offer – The DHCP server responds with an available IP address.
	3.	Request – The device requests to use that offered IP address.
	4.	Acknowledge – The server confirms and assigns it.

After that, the device receives:
	•	IP address
	•	Subnet mask
	•	Default gateway (router)
	•	DNS server

Where DHCP Is Usually Found

In home networks, the router normally acts as the DHCP server.

In business environments, a Windows Server or dedicated DHCP server handles it.

My Understanding So Far

DHCP makes network management easier because:
	•	You don’t have to manually configure every device
	•	It prevents IP conflicts
	•	It saves time
