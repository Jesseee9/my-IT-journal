What is Subnetting?

Subnetting is the process of dividing a large network into smaller networks (subnetworks).

Instead of having one big network where every device is grouped together,
subnetting allows an organisation to split the network into smaller sections for better management, security, and performance.

For example:
	•	HR department could be on one subnet
	•	IT department on another
	•	Finance on another

Each subnet works as part of the main network but operates as its own smaller network.

Why Subnetting is Used

Subnetting helps with:
	•	Better network organisation
	•	Improved performance (less broadcast traffic)
	•	Increased security (departments separated)
	•	Easier troubleshooting

It makes large networks more efficient and structured.

Subnet Mask

A subnet mask is used to determine which part of an IP address represents:
	•	The network portion
	•	The host portion

The subnet mask works together with the IP address to identify:
	•	The Network ID (Subnet ID)
	•	The valid host range
	•	The broadcast address

Example:
IP Address: 192.168.1.10
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

The subnet mask tells us which part identifies the network and which part identifies individual devices (hosts).

Key Idea
	•	Subnet = smaller network created from a larger one
	•	Subnet mask = tool used to divide network and host portions
	•	IP address + Subnet mask = used to calculate the subnet ID
